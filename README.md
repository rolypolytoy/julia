# julia
This is an interactive visualization of the julia sets. The real element and the imaginary elements can be moved with a slider.

You can increase the amount of iterations to 100 or higher, for better quality at the expense of some speed.

# Dependencies
You'll need the numpy, numba, matplotlib and tkinter libraries for this. These are necessary (or effectively necessary) for numerical acceleration and the UI. If you don't already have these, just do the following:

	pip install numpy numba matplotlib tkinter

Then run julia-set.py, and enjoy.
